# Information
This repository is based on *Evaluating the Security of Logic Encryption Algorithms, HOST 2015*, whose source code is available at https://bitbucket.org/spramod/host15-logic-encryption/src/default/. We test the four types of single-fault models where exactly 1 gate is camouflaged: nand->nor, nor->nand, xor->xnor, xnor->xor on the rnd_c880 benchmarks.

# Download
To clone this repository, use the following command.

`$ git clone https://github.com/Alwaysenchanted/camouflaged_logc_single_fault.git`

# Environment
These codes should be run on Ubuntu 64-bit Linux. Python3 is also needed.

# Run
First, make sure that you have already download the "host15-logic-encryption" repository from https://bitbucket.org/spramod/host15-logic-encryption/src/default/. Then, use the python3 scripts in the src directory to run the test and get the result.
